# odin-restaurant-page
Restaurant Page JavaScript Project from The Odin Project

Building from scratch, a dynamically rendering restaurant homepage, using JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents.

This project will also help solidify me recent learning of using ES6 Modules, npm and Webpack.
